### Security Findings Disposition

| Finding | Severity | Disposition |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `appointment_attendees` exposure | ERROR | ✅ FIXED — Protocol VIEW excludes email/phone |
| `clients` table exposure | ERROR | FALSE POSITIVE — RLS correctly restricts access |
| `cases` no DELETE policy | WARN | INTENTIONAL — Cases cannot be deleted |
| `reminders` no user policies | WARN | INTENTIONAL — System-managed only |
| `notifications` no INSERT/DELETE | WARN | INTENTIONAL — System-created, user-read only |
| `audit_events` no UPDATE/DELETE | WARN | INTENTIONAL — Append-only by design |
| `documents` no UPDATE policy | WARN | DEFERRED — Feature not in v1.0 |

### Known Limitations (By Design)
