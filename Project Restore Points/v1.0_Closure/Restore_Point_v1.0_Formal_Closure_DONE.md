## Performance Notes

### Module Switching Delay (After Hard Refresh)

**Observed Behavior:** Brief delay (~200-500ms) on first module switch after hard refresh

**Likely Causes:**
1. Session rehydration blocking (primary)
2. Lazy-loaded route chunk fetching
3. React Query cache cold start

**Remediation Options (NOT authorized for v1.0):**
1. Route prefetching for critical modules
2. Skeleton UI during lazy load
3. Service worker for asset caching

**Impact:** Minor UX inconvenience, not a blocker

## Freeze Declaration

The following are now FROZEN:

| Artifact | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Codebase (`/src`) | 🔒 FROZEN |
| Database Schema | 🔒 FROZEN |
| RLS Policies | 🔒 FROZEN |
| Configuration | 🔒 FROZEN |

Any future changes require v1.1 authorization.
